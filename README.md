## üéØ Vision: Your UW-Madison AI Companion

AskBucky is just the beginning! Our ultimate vision is to create a comprehensive one-stop-shop for all things UW-Madison. While we currently focus on dining hall menus and nutrition, we're planning to expand AskBucky into a unified platform that integrates multiple university data sources:
