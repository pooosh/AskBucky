### üéØ Vision: Your UW-Madison AI Companion

AskBucky is just the beginning! Our ultimate vision is to create a comprehensive one-stop-shop for all things UW-Madison. While we currently focus on dining hall menus and nutrition, we're planning to expand AskBucky into a unified platform that integrates multiple university data sources:

## üéØ About The Project

AskBucky transforms how you interact with dining hall menus through natural language conversation. Built on the powerful NLWeb framework, it provides an intuitive way to discover food options, get nutritional information, and plan balanced meals.

### Why AskBucky?

- **Real-time Menu Access**: Stay updated with current dining hall offerings across multiple locations
- **Dietary Accommodations**: Filter by dietary restrictions and allergen information

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Hall Support**: Access menus from multiple dining locations (Four Lakes Market, Gordon Avenue Market, etc.)
- **Temporal Awareness**: Get menu information for specific dates and meal times
- **Section-Based Navigation**: Explore different dining sections (Fired Up, 1849, Buona Cucina, etc.)
- **Nutritional Intelligence**: Automatic display of macronutrients and calorie information
